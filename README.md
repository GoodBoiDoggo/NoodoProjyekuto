## Developing

### Nodemon

You may install software like Nodemon to make life easier.
This method of installing is deprecated:
```
npm install nodemon --save -dev
```
Instead, use this method:
```
npm install nodemon --save --only=dev
```
For some reason, di sha ma save sa package.json as a dev dependecy. Bsin kailangan pa i type manually.

```
